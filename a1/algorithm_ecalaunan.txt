Assignment 1 Algorithm


Main Function
1: User enters data in the argument in the format yyyymmdd, yyyy/mm/dd, yyyy-mm-dd, or yyyy.mm.dd
2: If user enters more than 2 arguments exit program
3: If user enters anything that does not follow the format receives error
4: Sanitize, remove all the characters that are not numbers leaving only YYYYMMDD. 
5: Check after sanitize to see if there are 8 characters, if not return error and exit code
6: Check range of year to see if it is valid in range 1900- 9999, if not return error
7: Check range of month to see if it is valid 1-12, if not return error
8: Check if year lands on leap year, if it does adjust februarys amount of days, if not return error
9: Check day in month to see if it is valid, if not return error
0: Print new string that shows the users birthday in the format MMM DD, YYYY


Leap Year Function
1: Isolate user year string 
2: if year is a leap year, return true, if not return false

Sanitize Function
1: Takes user data and compares it to another list of allowed characters
2: if character is allowed add it to a new string, if not delete that character
3: return new string

Size Check Function
1: after sanitize function, get the length of the string
2: if the string is the correct length, return true, if not return false

Range Check Function:
1: takes the specific user input and compares it to a array
2: if the user input is within the arrays range return true, if not return false

Usage function:
1: check arguments to see if they are in correct format.
2: print the format the script should be called and return true.
